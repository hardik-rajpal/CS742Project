For some students, online education is a curse, while for others, it is a blessing that provides flexibility and convenience. The part that I enjoy the most about online education is the ease with which I can switch classrooms, without having to physically move from one location to another. The only way I will be happy if the campus reopens is if the lecture halls are accessible through a Chrome tab, without having to physically move from one location to another. The idea of a "flipped-classroom" model, where the students watch the pre-recorded lectures before having a live class, really relaxes the time constraints faced in traditional schooling. As advocated by Sal Khan from Khan Academy, the whole process can become perfection-centred rather than the usual complete-the-syllabus-on-time-centred. This fluidity of the schedule permits one to partition their time to maximise their efficiency and clarity in a concept; a point sadly overlooked in the conventional and offline teaching methods. These ideas being the bright side of the issue; there are screen-sharing mishaps, an absurd absence of a schedule in the lives of the undisciplined students, and loosely proctored quizzes to restore the balance. There's no stringent bus driver who's gonna leave you behind if you're not at the stop on time; no way for the teacher to genuinely threaten you for your disrespectful actions. Teachers have gone from the magicians in their five-star, one-person shows to street performers, begging for the least possible glance of interest at a medieval caf√©. There's no way they can suspend you, the only useful arrow in their otherwise hollow quavers, for being late to the zoom meeting; why of course, you had connectivity issues, who doesn't when there's a biology class at 8:30 in the morning? Another problem is the access to anonymity on specific platforms (Zoom, at least, when you don't know how to secure a meeting).
