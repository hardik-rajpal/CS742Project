The only way I am gonna be happy if the campus reopens is if the lecture halls are a Chrome tab away.

As advocated by Sal Khan from Khan Academy, the whole process can become perfection-centred rather than the usual complete-the-syllabus-on-time-centred.

Teachers have gone from the magicians in their five-star, one-person shows to street performers, begging for the least possible glance of interest at a medieval café.

        "# inputSents = \"\"\"Corruption is loosely understood as a display of dishonesty by a person in power, which results in unfair outcomes. This usually evokes the image of an obese (government) official accepting a seemingly innocent box of sweets across his desk, with a grin wide enough to swallow his ears. He accepts it in return for a favour asked by a politician, a criminal, a criminal politician, or, in one of the saddest circumstances, a common man. One whose stack of problems has finally persuaded him to abandon his morality. When we think of fighting against corruption, we imagine such slippery cogs being reported, caught and hopefully punished for their decisions. However, dishonesty, unfairness and power do manifest themselves in many places other than the greasy desks of government officials. When a businessman in a rush decides to join the queue at the hot dog stand, anywhere other than at the back of the queue, he’s abusing the power he has to ensure the functioning of a system as simple and elegant as the queue. Each participant has the power to ensure this by adhering to the unspoken rule of the queue: those who come first, shall be served first. To cut ahead of people is to blatantly lie about your arrival time to anyone joining the queue. Additionally, it is unfair to anyone you cut ahead of. For a moment, let’s reflect on the businessman and why he makes this arguably corrupt choice. One can cook up some backstory that paints our transgressor in a helpless light; maybe he was in a rush so he could visit his sick mother at the hospital before he returns to the mill to sweat out his blood and bruise his knuckles, just to keep up with the daily bills. While this is rarely the case, who’s to say that everyone else, or even anyone else, in the queue whom he’s robbing of fair treatment, has a life any more comfortable than his? His decision, therefore, can be seen as selfish and short-sighted. By his implicit argument, the right way to run a hot dog stand would be to have every incoming customer share their life story and have the urgence associated with their purchase evaluated by the others, to assign them a spot in this new priority queue.\"\"\"\n",
